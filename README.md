**File naming convention**

Each airport is sorted into a folder namned after the **ICAO code for that airport**. I that folder lies four main file types

*ICAOgimp.xcf - The GIMP file of the map, usuelly taken from a DCS F10 map screenshot.

*ICAO.docx - A Microsoft Word file containing the GIMP map overlayed on the Master Arms airport chart template.

*ICAOgimp.png - Exported image file from GIMP.

*ICAO.png - Image export of the completed Word file.

*ICAOinvert.png - Inverted export of the Word file, for night mission compatiblity.
